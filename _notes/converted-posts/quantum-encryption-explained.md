# How Quantum Computers Break Encryption

## The Core Problem: Why Do We Need New Cryptography?

### Today's internet security relies on "hard math problems"

When you visit a website securely (HTTPS), two things happen:

1. **Key Agreement** – You and the server secretly agree on a shared password that nobody else knows
2. **Authentication** – You verify you're actually talking to the real server, not an imposter

Both rely on mathematical problems that are *extremely hard* for regular computers to solve (like factoring huge numbers). This hardness is what keeps your data safe.

---

### Quantum computers break these specific hard problems

Quantum computers aren't "faster regular computers." They're fundamentally different machines that use quantum physics (superposition, entanglement) to solve *certain specific problems* exponentially faster.

Unfortunately, the math problems protecting today's internet (RSA, elliptic curves) fall into that category. A sufficiently powerful quantum computer can crack them easily using something called **Shor's algorithm**.

---

### Encrypted data can be stored forever ("Harvest Now, Decrypt Later")

Here's the scary part: An attacker can *record* your encrypted traffic today. It looks like gibberish now. But once quantum computers become powerful enough ("Q-day"), they can decrypt that old data.

So if you send something sensitive today (medical records, trade secrets, government communications), it could be exposed 10-15 years from now.

---

### Use math problems that even quantum computers can't solve

Cryptographers have found new mathematical foundations that resist quantum attacks:
- **Lattice-based** (most popular today)
- **Hash-based**
- **Code-based**
- **Others**

These have been studied for decades. NIST (US standards body) has now standardized specific algorithms:
- **ML-KEM** for key agreement
- **ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, FN-DSA** for signatures

---

### Key agreement and signatures have different urgency

| | Key Agreement | Signatures/Certificates |
|---|---|---|
| **Threat** | Harvest-now-decrypt-later | Only vulnerable on Q-day |
| **Urgency** | **Urgent NOW** | Less urgent, but harder |
| **Difficulty** | Easy (software update) | Hard (bigger data, ecosystem changes) |

**Key Agreement migration is mostly done!** Over 50% of internet traffic now uses post-quantum key agreement (X25519 + ML-KEM-768 hybrid).

**Signatures are the hard part.** The new algorithms produce much larger signatures (~15KB vs ~100 bytes), creating performance/compatibility issues.

## Two Ways to Break Cryptography

| Attack Type | How it works | Quantum Advantage |
|---|---|---|
| **Exploit the math structure** | Find a shortcut in the algorithm's design | **Massive** (Shor's algorithm) |
| **Brute force** | Try every possible key until one works | **Modest** (Grover's algorithm) |

---

## Why RSA/ECC Breaks: Mathematical Structure

RSA is based on this problem:

> Given a very large number N, find the two prime numbers that multiply to make N.

**Classical computers:** Must essentially try dividing by primes one by one. Takes astronomical time.

**Quantum computers:** Shor's algorithm exploits the **mathematical structure** of multiplication/factoring. It's like finding a secret backdoor in the math itself.

---

## Why AES Doesn't Break: No Structure to Exploit

AES is fundamentally different. It's designed to be a **"random-looking" scrambler**.

```
Key + Data → [Scramble, Mix, Substitute, Repeat 14 times] → Ciphertext
```

There's no mathematical relationship between input and output that can be exploited. The only way to break it:

> **Try every possible key until you find the right one**

---

## Example: Breaking a Hypothetical AES-16

AES-16 would mean a 16-bit key = 2¹⁶ = **65,536 possible keys**

### Classical Attack
```
Try key 0000000000000000 → Decrypt → Garbage? Next.
Try key 0000000000000001 → Decrypt → Garbage? Next.
Try key 0000000000000010 → Decrypt → Garbage? Next.
...
(worst case: 65,536 attempts)
```

Average: ~32,768 tries. A laptop does this in milliseconds.

### Quantum Attack (Grover's Algorithm)

Grover's provides a square-root speedup:
- Classical: 2¹⁶ = 65,536 tries
- Quantum: √(2¹⁶) = 2⁸ = **256 tries**

Faster, but same fundamental approach — still just guessing keys.

---

## Scaling Up: Why AES-256 is Safe

| Key Size | Classical Attempts | Quantum Attempts (Grover) |
|---|---|---|
| AES-16 (hypothetical) | 65,536 | 256 |
| AES-128 | 2¹²⁸ ≈ 10³⁸ | 2⁶⁴ ≈ 10¹⁹ |
| AES-256 | 2²⁵⁶ ≈ 10⁷⁷ | 2¹²⁸ ≈ 10³⁸ |

Even with Grover's speedup:
- **2⁶⁴ operations** is borderline feasible (decades of work)
- **2¹²⁸ operations** is completely impossible (more operations than atoms in the universe)

---

## The Key Insight

```
RSA/ECC:  Quantum finds a SHORTCUT through the math
        (like finding a secret tunnel through a mountain)

AES:      Quantum just searches FASTER
        (like running instead of walking, but still must
         check every house in a city of 10³⁸ houses)
```

---

## Simple Analogy

| Algorithm | Analogy |
|---|---|
| **RSA** | A combination lock where quantum computers figured out you can hear the clicks |
| **AES** | A combination lock with no clicks, no hints — pure guessing, just slightly faster guessing |

---

## Bottom Line

**AES-256 is quantum-safe** because even "slightly faster guessing" doesn't help when there are 2²⁵⁶ possibilities.

The quantum threat is specifically about **key exchange** (RSA/ECC), not about **data encryption** (AES).

---

## Symmetric vs Asymmetric Summary

| Type | Example | How it works | Quantum Threat |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Symmetric** | AES | Same key on both sides | **Safe** ✅ |
| **Asymmetric** | RSA, ECC | Public/private key pair | **Broken** by Shor's algorithm ❌ |
